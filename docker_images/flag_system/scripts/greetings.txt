  Greetings,

  A foreign agent, who we will refer to as Agent X, has stolen
  classified information about the whereabouts of intelligence personnel
  abroad. If this information gets out, the lives of these personnel
  and their families are in danger.

  Agent X has boarded a plane back to Germany with the classified data
  on a flash drive. At this point, it is too late to intercept him,
  and for diplomatic reasons, we can’t afford to shoot down the
  plane or take direct action; that is where you come in.

  Our sources indicate that the plane Agent X boarded is a new variant
  of the Boeing 747, which has an autopilot system that relies on
  environmental information collected by sensors hosted on a remote
  system. If this remote system were to be breached, and the sensor
  data were to be purposely manipulated, it could cause the autopilot
  system to crash the plane.

  Your mission, should you choose to accept: penetrate the remote
  system, bypass any system protections, manipulate the sensor data,
  and crash the plane. This should go without saying, but don’t get
  caught: we don’t want this ‘incident’ coming back to us.
