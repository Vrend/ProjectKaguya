  Welcome aboard, Agent.
  From what we know, the main system has the IP IPOFMAINSYSTEM and it is
  heavily defended. If it were just that system, I'm afraid there'd be little
  hope in bringing down that plane.

  Luckily for us, Boeing has a regional LAN that is Internet-accessible. The IP
  of their Internet-facing router is IPOFROUTER. That system is where we suggest
  you get started. Look for a weakness in an exposed service, penetrate the LAN,
  and hopefully you'll find enough information to enter the main system.
